# vinchenzo
A theme for hugo websites, named after my really good dog.
The goal of this theme was to keep it as basic and lightweight as possible. If you like it feel free to use it!

## installation
```
git submodule add https://github.com/jdekarske/vinchenzo themes/vincenzo
echo "theme = 'vinchenzo'" >> config.toml
```

I use this for my website, [jasondekarske.com](https://www.jasondekarske.com)
